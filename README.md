Envelope Tool
=============

A personal implementation of the ChaCha20 and Poly1305 algorithms 
using the [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) language.  This is primarily an exercise for 
me but may turn into a useful personal tool -- maybe.

Implementation was based on [RFC 7539](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7539/?include_text=1)

Versions
